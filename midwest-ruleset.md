# Midwest StarCraft Standard Ruleset
## Tournament Structure
### Schedule
Tournament schedule should be specified in that individual events announcement post, usually on TeamLiquid or Challonge.
### Checking in
Check-in begins 45 minutes before the scheduled start time of the tournament. Any players who do not check in during this period will be disqualified.
The method of checking in will be specified on the event-specific post, either on TL.net or Challonge.
### Prizes and Claiming
Each tournament should declare its prize distribution in its announcement posting.  
All tournament winnings will be paid through Matcherino, so it will be assumed that players are capable of receiving payment through that platform. Players are responsible for understanding the rules and regulations of payment through Matcherino.  
Should a player choose to forfeit their participation in the event, they shall lose any prize eligibility.
## General Rules of Operation
### In-game Settings
Players are allowed to select any in-game race at any time in the tournament, including changing races during a series.  
In-game skins: all unit skins are allowed.  
### Map Pool and Selection  
The tournament map pool will be the same as the 1v1 ladder map pool at the time of the event.
#### Map Selection Process
For every map selection process, the higher seeded player must choose to act as Player A or Player B. The exception to this is the grand final match in a double-elimination bracket, where the higher seeded player is the one from the winnerâ€™s side of the bracket.  
A vetoed map is one that cannot be picked to play during a series.  
Each map in a series may only be played once.  
**Best of 3 series**  
1. Player A vetoes 1 map
2. Player B vetoes 2 maps
3. Player A vetoes 1 map
4. Player B picks 1 map
5. Player A picks 1 map
6. Player B picks 1 map  

**Best of 5 series**  
1. Player A vetoes 1 map
2. Player B vetoes 1 map
3. Players alternate picking maps, starting with Player A  

**Best of 7 series**  
1. Players alternate picking maps, starting with Player A  

**Best of 7 series (1 game winner advantage)**  
1. Player B forfeits 1 maps
2. Players alternate picking maps, starting with Player B  

### Reporting Matches 
#### Responsibility to report
The winner of each series has the responsibility to report, either to a tournament admin or self-reporting, if possible. When applicable, include match replays to help with any match disputes.  
#### Replay formatting
If submitting replays, please use a format similar to the following:
*<Match number from bracket> - <Player 1> vs <Player 2> <Game #>*
### Tournament Structure
#### Player seeding
Seeding will be assigned through a rough combination of ladder rank and previous tournament placement, if any.  
The tournament bracket will only be finalized at the planned start time of the tournament series, so that any players who have not checked in may be removed from the bracket.  
#### Series format
Matches will be best of 3 games, except for the grand finals, which will be best of 7 (player from winners bracket gets 1-game advantage)  
#### Exceptional match circumstances
If a player disconnects during a match, the match should be recovered and resumed from replay.  
In the event of a draw, the game must be played again on the same map and in-game settings, such as players and race.  
### Ruling Decisions
All decisions made by the head tournament administrator are final. Any situations that are not specified in this document may be ruled upon per the administrators discretion.
## Player Responsibility
Late/absent policy
Players may have a 10 minute grace period between series, which can be extended if they contact both their opponent and a tournament admin. If players are missing for 10 minutes, they will forfeit their first game in the series. If players are missing for 15 minutes, then they will forfeit the full series. A tournament administrator may use their discretion to extend, but not shorten, this grace period.
Contact Information
All methods of contacting players, administrators, and organizers should be detailed in the tournament announcement.
Checking for Broadcast
Before a series begins, players should check if the official casters need a game to cast, so that they are able to broadcast as many games as possible.
## Player Conduct
### Rules of Conduct
The Midwest Cup is intended to be a positive and enjoyable experience for all participants, and the hope is that the player conduct will align with that principal. While we cannot govern what players do outside of the tournament, it is expected that while players participate in the tournament, they shall abide by a few rules of conduct:  
1. No harassment of any sort, to any other participants, through any channels of communication during the duration of the tournament.
2. No intentional unsportsmanlike conduct. This can include actions such as refusing to participate in map vetoes/picks, refusing to join game lobbies, etc.
3. Any player misconduct should be reported to only the members listed as tournament admins.
4. All decisions regarding player misconduct shall be made at the discretion of the tournament administrators.
### Consequences
Players engaging in misconduct will first receive a warning, and any additional misconduct will result in disqualification from the current tournament, as well as a temporary ban from one subsequent event.  
## Tournament Eligibility
### Age Requirement
The tournament does not have any specific age requirement, but it is expected that players comply with all age guidelines for prize payment, currently done through Matcherino.  
### Proof of Residency Requirement
The proof of residency requirement is only applicable to online events.
Only players that receive prizes, whether monetary, material, or services, from the event will need to provide proof of residency. All other participants will be assumed to meet residency requirements on good faith.  
Eligible states included in the Midwest region for our league are the following: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.  
To prove residency, participants will need to provide images of a non-expired, state-issued ID to the tournament organizer. This information will only ever be used for proof of eligibility, and shall not be distributed.  
## Broadcast Information
### Official Broadcasts
The official tournament broadcast information should be specified by the organizer through that individual tournament announcement posting.  
### Player Broadcasts
Players are allowed to broadcast their personal tournament matches, however do so at your own risk as it may expose you to stream cheating, which we cannot moderate. The official stream will have an adequate delay on it, but player streams will have no restrictions. If you do choose to stream your matches, it is appreciated if you also inform viewers of the official tournament stream.
